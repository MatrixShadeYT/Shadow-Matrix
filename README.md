# Creation of Shadow AI
I started this project because I saw Neuro-san from videl's channel and thought it might be a fun project to work on making myself one. It's definitely a lot more complex than I expected. There's tons of levels for what you need to do.
Here's a list of what you need to make in order to create a chatbot.
1 Speech-to-text, 2 Database, 3 Chatbot, 4 Text-to-speech<br>
But... Wait... If I'm going for something like Neuro-sama then I'll need to make a character model, animate in live2d then make it work with vtube studio.
5 Create-Model, 6 Animate, 7 Vtube-studio, 8 Movement.<br>
New idea, I use html, css, and js instead of python.
